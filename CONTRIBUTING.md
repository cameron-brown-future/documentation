# How to contribute

We encourage contributions from the community.
When creating content, please follow our [style guidance](/STYLE.md).

To ensure that each change is relevant and properly peer reviewed, we request that you adhere to best practices for open-source contributions.
If you are outside the Temporal organization, please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/issues) for any feedback more significant than a simple typo.
We review GitHub issues on a regular schedule.
